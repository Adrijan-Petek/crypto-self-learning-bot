# Web (placeholder)

This folder is a placeholder for a front-end dashboard. You can create a Next.js or React app here.
A minimal Next.js index page might fetch `reports/sample-report.json` and render charts.

Example quick-start:
```bash
npx create-next-app web
```
Then add an API route or static fetch to consume `reports/sample-report.json`.
